#summary Installing SWAT 4 the correct way
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This will lead you through installing SWAT 4 and configuring it and TortoiseSVN to work with our configs.

= Details =

If you don't own a copy of the game, you'll need to purchase it from [http://www.direct2drive.com/347/product/Buy-Swat-4-Gold-Download Direct2Drive] or from a shady deal who may or may not be located off-shore.

== SWAT 4 Installation ==

Install SWAT 4 somewhere under your user directory, so that TortoiseSVN doesn't need admin privs to write to it all of the time. Something like `C:\Users\will\SWAT 4` will work perfectly.

  * DO NOT install Gamespy Arcade
  * DO install the expansion
