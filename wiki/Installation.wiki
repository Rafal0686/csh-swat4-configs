#summary Installing SWAT 4 the correct way

= Introduction =

This will lead you through installing SWAT 4 and configuring it and TortoiseSVN to work with our configs.

= Details =

If you don't own a copy of the game, you'll need to purchase it from [http://www.direct2drive.com/347/product/Buy-Swat-4-Gold-Download Direct2Drive] or from a shady deal who may or may not be located off-shore.

== SWAT 4 Installation ==

Install SWAT 4 somewhere under your user directory, so that TortoiseSVN doesn't need admin privs to write to it all of the time. Something like `C:\Users\will\SWAT 4` will work perfectly.

  * DO NOT install Gamespy Arcade
  * DO install the expansion

== TortoiseSVN ==

Install TortoiseSVN normally. Install the command line tools.

=== Syncing with Google Code repo ===

First, you need to tell TortoiseSVN that your Swat 4 folder has some SVN shit in it.

  # Right-click in the `SWAT 4` folder, and select `SVN Checkout`
  # Enter `https://csh-swat4-configs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/` as the repo URL
  # Change checkout directory to the top level of the SWAT 4 installation folder
  # Click OK

Before playing with other CSHers, it's a good idea to manually sync to the Google Code repo. To sync:

  # Right-click your SWAT 4 folder
  # Click `SVN Update`
  # Enjoy!
